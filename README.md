# Hi there
#### I’m Vasco, and I hold a degree in Informatics and Computer Engineering (L.EIC) from the University of Porto. I am currently pursuing a Master in Artificial Intelligence (M.IA) at the University of Porto.

I intend to use this profile to showcase the projects/work I’ve done over time.
